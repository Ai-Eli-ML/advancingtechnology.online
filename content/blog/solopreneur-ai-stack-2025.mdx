People always ask what tools I use. Here's the complete, unfiltered list—everything that powers my one-person AI business in 2025.

## The Philosophy

Before the list: my stack is optimized for **speed to ship** and **low operational overhead**. I'm one person. I can't manage complex infrastructure. Every tool needs to earn its place.

## Development

### Framework: Next.js 15 + React 19
Why: Server components, app router, incredible DX. I build everything in Next.js now.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

### Language: TypeScript (Strict Mode)
Why: Catches bugs before they ship. Strict mode is non-negotiable.

### Styling: Tailwind CSS v4
Why: Utility-first CSS is faster for solo devs. No context switching between files.

### Components: shadcn/ui
Why: Copy-paste components I can customize. No vendor lock-in.

## AI/ML

### Primary LLM: Claude (Anthropic)
Why: Best reasoning, longest context, most reliable. I use Claude for:
- Complex code generation
- Document analysis
- Multi-step reasoning tasks

### Secondary LLM: OpenAI GPT-4
Why: Better for certain creative tasks, embeddings, and the Realtime API for voice.

### Local Models: Ollama + Qwen2.5-14B
Why: Free inference for non-critical tasks. Runs on my RTX 5090.

```bash
ollama run qwen2.5:14b
```

### Voice: NVIDIA Riva + NeMo
Why: On-device voice processing. Low latency, high quality, GPU-accelerated.

### Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
Why: Best quality-to-cost ratio for RAG applications.

## Database & Backend

### Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
Why: Postgres with auth, RLS, realtime, and edge functions built in. One service, many features.

### Auth: Supabase Auth
Why: Already included. Social logins, magic links, everything I need.

### File Storage: Supabase Storage
Why: S3-compatible, already integrated.

### Edge Functions: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)
Why: Serverless functions near the database.

## Infrastructure

### Hosting: Vercel
Why: Best-in-class Next.js deployment. Preview deployments for every PR.

### Domain/DNS: Cloudflare
Why: Free, fast, great DX. All my domains use Cloudflare.

### Monitoring: Vercel Analytics + Custom Logging
Why: Built-in analytics, custom logging to Supabase for debugging.

## Development Tools

### Editor: VS Code + Claude Code CLI
Why: Claude Code is my pair programmer. Game changer.

### Git: GitHub
Why: Industry standard. GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Package Manager: pnpm
Why: Faster than npm, better monorepo support.

### Testing: Vitest
Why: Fast, Vite-native, great DX.

## AI Development Workflow

### Prompt Management: Local MDX Files
Why: Version controlled, easy to iterate. No SaaS lock-in.

### Agent Framework: Custom (based on LangChain patterns)
Why: LangChain is great for learning, but I've extracted what I need into a lighter custom implementation.

### RAG: Custom with pgvector
Why: Vector search directly in Postgres. No additional service.

## Business Operations

### Email: Resend
Why: Developer-first email API. Simple pricing.

### Payments: Stripe
Why: Industry standard. Great docs.

### Analytics: Plausible
Why: Privacy-focused, lightweight. No cookie banners needed.

### Project Management: Personal Dashboard (my own tool)
Why: I built exactly what I need.

## The Stack Summary

| Category | Tool | Monthly Cost |
|----------|------|--------------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 | Free |
| Database | Supabase Pro | $25 |
| Hosting | Vercel Pro | $20 |
| AI APIs | Claude + OpenAI | ~$100 |
| Email | Resend | $20 |
| Domains | Cloudflare | Free |
| Payments | Stripe | 2.9% + $0.30 |
| **Total** | | **~$165/month** |

## What I Tried and Dropped

- **Firebase**: Too much vendor lock-in
- **AWS**: Too complex for solo dev
- **Prisma**: Supabase's auto-generated types are good enough
- **Redux**: React 19's built-in state is sufficient
- **Contentful**: MDX files are simpler for my needs

## The Principle

Every tool should:
1. Save me time
2. Be reliable (99.9%+ uptime)
3. Have escape hatches (data portability)
4. Cost less than the time it saves

If a tool doesn't meet all four criteria, I don't use it.

## Your Stack Doesn't Need to Be Fancy

I know devs who ship successful products with:
- Plain JavaScript
- SQLite
- A $5 VPS

The best stack is the one you can ship with. Don't over-engineer.
