Two years ago, I was driving Uber to pay rent.

I'd pick up passengers at 5am, drive until noon, grab a few hours of sleep, then drive the dinner rush. Rinse and repeat. The money was okay, but I knew it wasn't sustainable.

One night, around 2am, I picked up a tech founder from SFO. He was rambling about AI, about how it was going to change everything. I mostly nodded along, half-listening. But something stuck.

"The barrier to entry has never been lower," he said. "Anyone with a laptop and determination can build something valuable now."

I couldn't stop thinking about it.

## The First 6 Months: Learning in the Dark

I had no computer science degree. No connections in tech. No idea what I was doing.

I started with YouTube tutorials. Python basics. Then APIs. Then machine learning fundamentals. I'd watch videos between rides, scribble notes on receipts, and practice coding on my lunch breaks.

ChatGPT had just launched. I started using it obsessively—not just to learn, but to have actual conversations about code. Over the next two years, I'd have over 8,446 conversations with ChatGPT. That's not a typo.

Every question I had, I asked. Every error message, I debugged. Every concept I didn't understand, I broke down until it clicked.

## The First Project (That Failed)

My first real project was a disaster. A "revolutionary" chatbot for local businesses. I spent three months building it. The code was spaghetti, the UI was ugly, and the underlying logic made no sense.

Zero users. Zero interest. Complete failure.

But here's what I learned: shipping something—anything—teaches you more than a hundred tutorials. I understood databases now. I understood APIs. I understood why good UX matters.

Failure is data.

## The Second Project (That Almost Worked)

Six months in, I built a simple automation tool. It helped small businesses respond to customer reviews automatically. Nothing fancy, but it solved a real problem.

I got 12 paying customers at $30/month. That's $360 MRR. Not life-changing, but proof that someone would pay for something I built.

More importantly, I learned how to talk to customers. How to understand their actual problems versus the problems I assumed they had.

## Going Full-Time

By month 14, I had enough savings and confidence to quit Uber. This was terrifying. No safety net, no guaranteed income, just me and my laptop.

The first month was brutal. I worked 12-hour days, building and failing and building again. I started Life-Coach-Ai—an AI therapeutic companion for vulnerable populations. The ambition scared me, but I couldn't shake the vision.

## Today: 3 Products in Production

Fast forward to now. I have three products generating revenue:

1. **Life-Coach-Ai** - 75% complete, serving real users with a 30-agent architecture
2. **Personal Dashboard** - 92% complete, my own project management platform
3. **Client work** - Building AI systems for businesses

I'm not rich. I'm not famous. But I'm building real things that help real people.

## What I'd Tell My Past Self

1. **Start before you're ready.** You'll never feel ready. Ship anyway.

2. **Talk to users early.** Don't build in a vacuum. Feedback is oxygen.

3. **Use AI as leverage.** ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot—these tools 10x your productivity. Use them.

4. **Document everything.** Your 8,000 ChatGPT conversations are a goldmine of content and learning.

5. **The $1B exit goal isn't crazy.** Audacious goals attract audacious results.

## What's Next

I'm building in public now. Sharing everything—the wins, the losses, the tools that actually work.

If you're where I was two years ago, driving rideshare or working a job that doesn't fulfill you, know this: the barrier to entry has never been lower.

You have a laptop. You have AI tools. You have determination.

That's enough to start.
